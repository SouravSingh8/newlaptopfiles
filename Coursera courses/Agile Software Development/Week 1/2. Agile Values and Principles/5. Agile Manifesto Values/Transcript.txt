00:00
so it was 2001 and a group of software
00:03
visionaries gathered at a ski resort to
00:06
share their experiences and figure out
00:08
why so many software projects were
00:10
failing this wasn't just about
00:11
documenting best practices they knew the
00:14
industry required a fundamental shift in
00:16
values and so the agile manifesto was
00:19
born the Declaration of for bold value
00:22
statements that became the basis of a
00:24
new approach to software development and
00:26
would change the industry forever but
00:29
what were those four values and why
00:31
should you care take a look but first it
00:34
is important to point out that the agile
00:36
manifesto ends by noting that all of the
00:38
things mentioned are important just that
00:41
some things must be prioritized over
00:42
others okay here we go number one
00:46
individuals and interactions over
00:48
processes and tools
00:49
this doesn't mean throw processes and
00:52
tools out the window simply means that a
00:54
good face-to-face chat should trump
00:56
rigid workflows and impersonal forms of
00:58
communication number two working
01:01
software over comprehensive
01:03
documentation makes sense right but
01:06
traditional software development often
01:08
produced extensive documentation before
01:10
a program was released for initial
01:12
testing some documentation is good but
01:15
wouldn't it be better to have the
01:16
program than a book describing it number
01:19
three customer collaboration over
01:20
contract negotiation sure you'll want to
01:23
start out with some initial guidelines
01:25
but instead of locking customers in a
01:27
cage by defining the exact details of
01:29
the project before it starts teams and
01:31
customers should collaborate to find the
01:33
best solutions and finally number four
01:36
responding to change over following a
01:38
plan nothing ever goes entirely
01:41
according to plan
01:42
so instead of sticking with something
01:43
that isn't working it's much more
01:45
effective to make adjustments as your
01:47
situation changes following the values
01:50
isn't always easy but when you build
01:52
them into your team's processes
01:54
customers notice hey
01:56
is huge which of the agile values do you
02:00
think is the most important
